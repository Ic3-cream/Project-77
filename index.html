    Visual studie code is a great app and it is easy to code on (use). These are some instructions if you want to use it. First you must downlode the app. Second you must create a folder to save all your work. Third you must make a file. Fourth open visual studio code up and choose your folder. Last of all go on and get coding.

    The console screen is great. It is great because you can always see your errors with it and if you have visual studeo code (and if you don't make sure to get it. I have told you how above!). You can code your own things on their to see (I'm sure you will be very happy with yourself if you ever manage to do that. Although I definetly can).
